# ComPhy_Programmes
The code for all algorithms of the Computational Physics course of BITS Pilani Pilani Campus<br>
This was created for Sem-1 2023<br>
IC: Nawin Singh<br><br>
I used C++ for the programs. If you want to run the code, get VS Code and follow the instructions on setting a C++ compiler.<br>
Later I found C++ sucks so I changed to Python, special thanks to Shreyan Prakash for this
